# About this Project
Alura front-end immersion was an online event that took place from January 22 to 26, 2024. There were five classes in total, delving into knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React and Angular. Most of the development was guided by the school's instructors, but there were also challenges for students to reproduce the proposed model and get hands-on experience.

## Objective
The goal of this project was to replicate the Spotify page using the aforementioned technologies. Additionally, it aimed to provide a closer experience to the reality of website development.
